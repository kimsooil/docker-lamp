# .env

## Purpose

The *.env* file is used to set and pass in command line arguments to containers. 

## How to.

- Copy the *sample.env* file to *.env*
- Replace all the relevant keys with the appropriate values. **NOTE** The same fields in the *.env* file can also be found in the *environment* sections in *docker-compose.yml* file. However, in the *docker-compose.yml* file, the keys are 'just' listed (i.e. no values attached). This tells docker to fetch them from current environment which is set using your *.env* file.
- Start your docker file.
